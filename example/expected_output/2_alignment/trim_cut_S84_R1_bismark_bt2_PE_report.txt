Bismark report for: /home/ultron/Git/GAMBA/example/fastqs/1_trimmed_reads/trimmomatic/cutadapt/trim_cut_S84_R1.fastq.gz and /home/ultron/Git/GAMBA/example/fastqs/1_trimmed_reads/trimmomatic/cutadapt/trim_cut_S84_R2.fastq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/ultron/Git/GAMBA/example/genome/ with the specified options: -q -D 15 -R 2 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10248
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	9704
Mapping efficiency:	94.7% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	544
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	0
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	4

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	5029	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	4670	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	1	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	0	((converted) bottom strand)
